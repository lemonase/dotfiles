# My Windows "dotfiles"

## Instructions

Due to the lack of CLI programs on Windows, I tend to just copy the relevant
files into my `%USERPROFILE%` dir and call it a day.

### PowerShell Core

In PowerShell core, the user configuration profile is located at the variable
`$PROFILE`, which is `$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
on my Windows 10 machine.
